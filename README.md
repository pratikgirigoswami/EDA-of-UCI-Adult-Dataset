# EDA-of-UCI-Adult-Dataset
This project was aimed to practice exploratory data analysis for the defined dataset to get insights of data. The tasks performed were as per following: 

• Data acquisition of UCI Adult Dataset 

• Pre-processing – Imputation, Heatmap 

• EDA – Visualizing different graphs for understanding relationships among data components 

• Preparation for classification – label encoding, one-hot encoding, Train-Test Split 

• Model selection – KNN 

• Evaluation – prediction, confusion matrix, accuracy 

• Software/Tools/Programming Language Used: Python
